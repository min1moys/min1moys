**min1moys** — System Administrator and Cybersecurity Specialist.

### DESCRIPTION
Focused on the administration of secure, Linux-based environments and the implementation of privacy-preserving infrastructure. I specialize in system hardening, network analysis, and maintaining digital sovereignty.

My approach combines technical precision with an analytical perspective derived from interests in psychology and logic. I build systems designed to operate autonomously and securely.

### AREAS OF EXPERTISE
* **System Administration:** Advanced Debian management, server automation, and disaster recovery planning.
* **Cybersecurity:** Vulnerability assessment, system hardening, and privacy engineering.
* **Development:** Backend scripting and tool creation for infrastructure management.

### NOTES
I prioritize open-source solutions and transparent architecture.
Esthetics and order are functional requirements, not optional additions.
